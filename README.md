### Project Introduction

Social demographic factors such as gender and age group have known to be a large determinant for party popularities in Malaysian general elections. Our company, MyFuture.com is 
assigned to develop a Preliminary Data Analysis on Voting Distribution System (PreDAVD) using an object-oriented C++ programming language approach which purpose is to perform a data analysis in 
predicting the popularities of the current parties in Malaysia. 

The PreDAVD system should be able to read and record voters general and detailed information from an input file or a manually entered information from the user of the system. General information of voters should include name, Identification Card (I.C.) number, gender and 
state, meanwhile detailed information should include parliament number, DUN number, contact information, date of birth and party of interest. Corresponding to the main objective of the system, 
the system should perform an overall distribution analysis for all parties and demographic distribution according to gender and age groups of a specific parliament. Other main functions also 
include searching for a voter’s information from an input I.C. number and displaying available voter’s information.
